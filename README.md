# Trading Card Collection Manager - Project

TCM is a hobby project that I sometimes work on when time allows if I feel like it.
The project is still fairly new and I'm still learning Flutter and dart.
I've had the idea for an app like this for a while, but I never managed to get started so hopefully this time I can make it through.

At the time IÂ´m firstly working on the design and look of the app. I tested some functionalities for scanning cards etc. in another project.

## Idea
The app is intended to make it possible to manage a card collection by simply scanning the cards. Further information about a card should also be displayed when it is scanned with the cell phone camera.
